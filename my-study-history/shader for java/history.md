12/17 just started learning shader (openGL shading language)

using these two websites: https://thebookofshaders.com/01/ and https://openglbook.com/chapter-0-preface-what-is-opengl.html

the texts is very complecated but it's so fun to learn. I understood the history of shader, and gpu a little bit.

Ohh i have to go work! 12:30-21:00
